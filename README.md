## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)
Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually **yes, with attribution**.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

Please also note that I did not build this site with the intention of it being a starter theme, so if you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

As a backend, I used [Strapi](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/introduction.html) Headless CMS. By adding strapi record, you can generate your portfolio website.  If you want to build your portfolio easily then direct contact me via [email](mailto:richardhong33@hotmail.com) or you can find my detail contact from my [portfolio website](http://richardhong.epizy.com)

Also you can use hardcorded static seed eitherðŸ˜‰
